    'if you are not allergic to pets. I remember, in childhood and when I was a teen we had a fluffy Persian cat, her name was Sindy. She died at the age of 14.5 a few years ago, unfortunately. She was very patient, I used to put a cold wet cloth on my forehead and a cat on my pillow when going to bed and thus I could fall asleep. Her death was a great loss for me as our family cat was curing me. Though, nobody lives forever... The only thing I want to bring up: do not bring pets to children if they would abuse animals. I do think, kids should be tough to be careful with alive creatures and nature as it is we who live in this world, but not the world which owes us.',
  questionsH: 'Some common questions I often hear from people and how I react',
  question1: "Why don't you smile?",
  answer1:
    "I hear that very often and usually from random people, but I prefer not to explain to others my medical problem. Sometimes people are annoying and they want you to behave happily and entertain them. I do not think, I should follow what somebody may want, so I don't. Many are not considerate, they even do not think, that such a question is minimum rude as it is a personal matter. I ignore such question if it is from somebody random or may answer that I have chronic pain if it is from somebody I know. Though, in society, I usually tend to press out a smile so that nobody would notice as business ethics requires to stay professional.",
  question2: 'Why is your smile sad?',
  answer2:
    'As a rule, only people who know you have the right to ask you this personal question. Usually, I either do not answer or I tell I have chronic pain. Honestly, I am not looking for understanding, but I think, such questions are extra. In my opinion, if you care, better suggest helping instead of asking this question.',
  question3: 'Why are you taking so many painkillers?',
  answer3:
    'I have never heard this question from random people, that is why I could tell about my health issue.',
  question4: "Why don't you go to nightclubs, bars, parties?",
  answer4:
    '"Well, imagine you have severe pain. Would you like to go partying?" But be prepared to answer a chain of related questions or to explain to the "interviewer" that it is not his or her business.',
  question5: "What should I do? I don't know what to do",
  answer5:
    'This was a standard question from my ex-husband. I told him, he simply thus found a reason to run away from the problem. Sometimes he was shouting and applying psychological pressure and twice I thought my heart would give up. After the second time, I left him. Otherwise, if it is an honest question from your family member or somebody close like your spouse, I believe, you should explain and teach this person how he or she could help you, especially which actions to take when you have a pain crisis. Everyone has problems, that is perfectly fine to take care of each other.',
  lastP:
    'The majority of people are clueless, how one may live with severe neverending pain, so I would suggest not taking their attitude towards you personally (if it is not abusive, of course).',
