  headline: 'Intro',
  p1: 'I have been living in severe pain, mainly headaches and neck spasms, for more than 25 years. During my life, I have been through many examinations like blood works, scans, MRI, etc., visited doctors in several countries, tried different kinds of medication (including opioids) and alternative methods. Different doctors told me different diagnoses: neck vertebrae disorder, neurological neck pain, pain caused by blood vessels dysfunction, etc.',
  p2: 'Sometimes the pain is so bad, that I have to stay in bed as a “vegetable” with ice on my forehead as no medication work (such days I call “vegetable days”). In March 2020, during the first COVID lock-down in Toronto, I got to the ambulance with severe pain in the whole body, it felt like a fever, so I suspected I got corona. At the hospital, the doctor told me the pain was caused by muscle contractions spasms. After that occasion, I learned as much about muscle spasms as I could find in books and on the web and decided to try to ease my pain as if its nature lied in muscle spasms, and I got significant relief. I came to such ways of dealing with muscle pain on my own, so I decided to share my findings and experience with the world.',

The professional approach should be applied and I do recommend visiting a doctor and going through a proper examination (like MRI, biopsy, or something else depending on the individual case) as causes of muscle pain could be different. Even if the nature of pain could not be obvious, it's always a good practice to exclude possible causes. Then, you could discuss the information from here with your doctor to see if some things could be useful in your case.",
