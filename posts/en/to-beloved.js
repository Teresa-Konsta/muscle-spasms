    'How to help your beloved one who has been living with muscle pain, how to support this person.',
  p1: "Whether you are a spouse, a fiance, or a relationship partner, you are somebody beloved and hence important. Chronic pain isn't considered to be a disability, but probably you have already noticed, that indeed it provide certain restrictions to its owner's life. Though, if your valentine matters to you, you can and should help.",
  p2: "It is often the case when people in pain either prefer to live alone or to skip complaining and telling anything about the pain to avoid burdening others. But it doesn't mean they are really fine. Chronic pain is never fine. It is something that may get worse any moment. So, how can you assist your partner?",
  p3: 'First of all, I would suggest discussing with your partner what he or she usually does in different cases. Explain to your beloved one, that you are concerned and willing to support. Ask your partner to teach you to provide him or her with needed aid. Thus, you will be aware of what to do and your partner soon would feel more relaxed knowing he or she can fully rely on you. Probably you have a question, how could be otherwise in relationships. I would say, yes it can. My ex-husband always used to turn his back to me. He used to say: "But I do not know what to do!" and ran away. He did not want to help, he did not care and thus he found a reason to escape. He was just standing and staring at me when I was in severe pain. I hated him for that and I will never forgive him, though he thinks he was right. Yes, such relations end up quickly.',
  p4: 'Second, do not be pitty at your beloved. The pain is chronic and will not disappear. Better help, care, assist when needed, but treat this person the same way as everyone else. Chronic pain is just a pain, one can do the same things as everyone else with it, even though certain preparations could be required. But hope you would agree, that is not an issue.',
  p5: 'Third, please, remember that any stress and anxiety increase the pain. They can make your valentine end up in the ambulance. So, think of potential consequences before you are about to argue. Also, a person could be a bit more nervous than usual under the progressing pain, please, consider that fact. The solution would be to visit a psychologist together if you often argue.',
  p6: 'These are just my pieces of advice, it is always up to you what to do.',
