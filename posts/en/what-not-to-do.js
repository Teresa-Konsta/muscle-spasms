    mainP: "Despite the overall common, that this non-invasive method treats a range of illnesses, in my case it only added more troubles. Seems like all side-effects of this procedure are hidden for who knows what reason. When I studied at secondary school, my mother was recommended osteopathy by some doctors and decided that I should try it. Back then I was misdiagnosed with osteochondrosis (and nobody could explain, what exactly was wrong and how a toddler could get such health issues common for seniors). Those doctors said it was safe. Nowadays I would answer it was bullshit. All-in-all, it did not treat my chronic pain and I only got troubles with my spine and neck for the rest of my life. So, I would say osteopathy does have risks and I don't think it is a solution for chronic muscle pain."
