### Life with chronic muscle pain

I have been living in severe pain, mainly headaches and neck spasms, for more than 25 years.
During my life, I have been through many examinations, tried different kinds of medication and alternative methods.
I created this front-end to share my experience dealing with this hard syndrome and my hypothesis on what could be the cause.
