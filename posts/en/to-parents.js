    'What could you do if your child sufferes from a severe muscle pain and what would be better to avoid. How could you support your kid and make his or her life easier.',
  p1: 'Here I would like to say a few words to parents, whose child experiences bad chronic muscle pain or headaches.',
  p2: "First of all, do not panic as that will not make your kid feel better, but vice versa may negatively affect the kid's mental health. Same as there is no logic in blaming a child in possible simulation. Children tend to simulate and manipulate, but believe me, it is not the case. It is about chronic pain, that gets only worse. A child is asking for help, he or she realizes, that school could not be escaped and with time would probably even envy healthy classmates. My father in my childhood was blaming me for simulating the pain as no doctor could set a diagnosis and only my mother supported me. I was losing feelings sometimes from severe pain and was released from school back home when such occasions took place during classes. I studied well and was a good pupil, teachers believed me. If my mother didn't support and stand by me, I have no idea how I would have survived.",
  p3: "Second, besides treatment and supporting your kid's health, I would recommend trying to live as all usual families do (going  out with your family sometimes, etc.). You may ask your child, what makes him or her happy to figure out the child's preferences and talents. Physical hobbies (dancing, swimming, gymnastics) could be beneficial as well as creative ones. Also, you may visit a psychologist altogether  to get some professional recommendations.",
  p4: 'Last but not least, please, remember your mental health is also important for your child. So, you should not forget to take care of yourself as well.',
