There are several types of muscle contractions, more information could be found',
  p2: 'Muscle pain is called myalgia. Spasms occur if the normal functioning of muscle fibers is distorted, which also could be caused by a temporary inflammatory process in the body. Here I wouldn’t talk about cases that require hospitalization or are caused by temporary factors. More information about muscle diseases could be read',
  p3: 'I would like to discuss chronic muscle pain, which could be difficult to diagnose but which causes enormous discomfort in everyday life. In many cases such pain is localized, meaning when not all body muscles are sore but a certain muscle group, especially under certain conditions (applying some mechanical pressure by putting a bag on the shoulder, doing some movements). When muscles are pretty much irritated, it feels like a fever, but muscles with chronic pain are usually warmer than healthy ones as the inflammatory process takes place in them and heats up tissues. More information about usual muscle spasms could be found',
  p4: 'How one may get chronic muscle pain? Unfortunately, there is no clear answer. I asked a few doctors how a patient could get chronic muscle spasms in early childhood, and they mentioned these factors:',
